This is a starter template for conducting a multiverse analysis using the [multiversum](https://pypi.org/project/multiversum/) Python package.

It uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage the environment, so you may need to install this first.

You can start the analysis by running the following command (this will automatically install required packages).

```bash
uv run -m multiversum
```

## Using the Template

To use this template, fork it or click the button titled **Use this template** to get your own copy of the template. Alternatively, you can [download the template](https://github.com/jansim/multiversum-template/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) as a ZIP file.

You can then start to tweak the `universe.ipynb` to add your own analysis and later on the `multiverse.toml` to specify the different dimensions that should be explored in your multiverse analysis.

If you need additional Python packages, you can install them using `uv add <package>`.
